##   🛠️ Languages and Tools:

   Here's a more accurate and professional way to display these:

   -   **Python:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
   -   **SQL:** ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-005a9c?style=flat&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)  (or use a more generic SQL badge if you're not exclusively using MySQL)
   -   **Power BI:** ![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power_BI-F2C811?style=flat&logo=powerbi&logoColor=black)
   -   **AWS:** ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-232F3E?style=flat&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white)
   -   **Excel:** ![Microsoft Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Excel-217346?style=flat&logo=microsoft-excel&logoColor=white)

   **Explanation of Changes and Why:**

   * **Accurate Links and Emojis:**
        * I've checked and ensured the LinkedIn and email links are correctly formatted.
        * I've kept most of your existing emojis, as they are generally appropriate for a GitHub README.
   * **Shields.io Badges:**
        * I've used **shields.io** for the language and tool display. Shields.io is a widely used service for creating clean, consistent badges on GitHub. This is a more professional and standardized way to show your tech stack.
        * **Color Accuracy:** I've adjusted the colors in the shields.io badges to be more accurate representations of the logos (e.g., Python's official colors).
        * **Style Consistency:** I've used `style=flat` for a consistent, modern look.
        * **Logo Accuracy:** I've ensured the correct logos are used (e.g., `logo=python`, `logo=mysql`, etc.).
   * **Organization:** I've organized the badges into a list for better readability.
